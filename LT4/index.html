         <h3> Alone in the Forest</h3>
          <h4>By Supraja Kannan</h4> 
            <p> The rhythm of the stream nearby
                <br>
                and the grazing sound of the deer
                <br>
                were the finest music I had ever heard.<br>
                <br>
                I could still see the glimpses of
                <br>
                the cutest cheetah cub,who came as a refugee
                <br>
                and the malicious monkey and its wavy long tail.<br>
                <br>
                Those were the good old days where the,
                <br>
                migratory birds perform meteoric murmuration,
                <br>
                before roosting on my arms.<br>
                <br>
                In pursuit of the streams round me;
                <br>
                in hunt of the deers and cheetah,
                <br>
                I was about to inquire my neighbors,
                <br>
                later savvied I was lingering there all alone,
                <br>
                I sobbed like a missed child,
                <br>
                gazing at the sky,
                <br>
                with a vacuous mind.<br>
                <br>
                Suddenly an endemic bird
                <br>
                landed on me and said
                <br>
                I am the last tree of this forest.
